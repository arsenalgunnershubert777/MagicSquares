# MagicSquares
research project to create algorithms to find magic squares
## Description:
Magic squares are n by n matrices filled with the numbers 1 through n^2, in which the columns, rows, and diagonals all add up to the same sum. After working on a programming project to find magic squares of a certain size, I was interested in seeing what algorithms could be used to find ALL possible magic squares of a certain size. I have created a program to find all squares of size n = 3 and n = 4.
