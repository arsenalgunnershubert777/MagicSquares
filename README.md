# MagicSquares
research project to create algorithms to find magic squares
## Description:
Magic squares are n by n matrices filled with the numbers 1 through n^2, in which the columns, rows, and diagonals all add up to the same sum. After working on a programming project to find magic squares of a certain size, I was interested in seeing what algorithms could be used to find ALL possible magic squares of a certain size. I first made a program to brute force through every permutation and found all of them of size n=3, but for n=5, it would take very long. With some guidance from Professor Kavalan at the University of Florida, I am looking towards implementing greedy algorithms and eventually dynamic programming to hopefully find all magic squares for n=5. The code I currently have is just my brute force algorithm.
